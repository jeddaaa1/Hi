            Hi i don't really know your name and I didn’t want to stay a stranger, so I figured I’d say hi.
            I know this might be a bit random, I came across your profile and thought you seemed really interesting.
			You seem really cool, and I’d love to get to know you better. 
            How’s your day going?
